cooper appeared familiar parachutes although his experience level unknown mucklow said cooper appeared completely familiar parachutes which furnished     told journalist cooper put his parachute as

training wear emergency parachutes know how dispatch items from planes flight as cargo loader cooper familiar parachutes not necessarily sufficient knowledge survive jump made   from beginning fbi s investigation some agents speculated cooper probably not survive his jump several reasons facts support belief cooper s apparent lack skydiving experience his lack proper equipment his jump survival temperature inclement weather night hijacking wooded terrain into which cooper jumped his lack knowledge his landing area unused ransom money first cooper appeared lack necessary skydiving knowledge skills experience type jump attempted carr said originally thought cooper experienced jumper perhaps even paratrooper   further said concluded after few years simply not true no experienced parachutist jumped pitch black night rain   mph   m s wind his face wearing loafers trench coat simply too risky   alternatively skydiving instructor earl cossey who supplied parachutes testified cooper not needed extensive experience survive jump anyone who six seven practice jumps accomplish     however cossey also noted jumping night drastically increased risk injury without jump boots cooper probably suffered severe ankle leg injuries upon landing     second cooper not appear equipment necessary either his jump his survival wilderness neither brought nor requested helmet     jumped

like roughly size small bear row spines reaching from neck base tail while southwestern united states depicted as more dog like initial sightings accompanying descriptions first occurred puerto rico   creature since reported as far north as maine as far south as chile even outside americas countries like russia philippines all reports anecdotal disregarded as uncorroborated lacking evidence sightings northern mexico southern united states verified as canids afflicted mange     chupacabras literally translated as goat sucker from chupar suck cabras goats known as both chupacabras

many farms reported loss animal life each animals reported its body bled dry through series small circular incisions first reported attack eventually attributed actual chupacabras occurred march   eight sheep discovered dead puerto rico each three puncture wounds chest area reportedly completely drained blood   few months later august eyewitness named madelyne tolentino reported seeing creature

nicaragua panama peru united states     video recorded mundo ovni showed results supposed attack chickens seburuquillo sector lares puerto rico   five year investigation benjamin radford documented

identical tolentino s chupacabra eyewitness account seen movie before report creature looked like chupacabra spines its back all resemblance chupacabra really impressive tolentino reported   radford revealed tolentino believed creatures events saw species happening reality puerto rico time therefore concludes most important chupacabra description cannot trusted   radford believes seriously undermines credibility chupacabra as real animal   reports blood sucking chupacabra never confirmed necropsy   only way conclude animal drained blood dr david morales puerto rican veterinarian department agriculture analyzed   reported victims chupacabra found not bled dry   radford divided chupacabra reports into two categories reports from puerto rico latin america where animals attacked supposed their blood extracted reports united states mammals mostly dogs coyotes mange people call chupacabra due their unusual appearance     university michigan biologist barry o connor concluded all chupacabra reports united states simply coyotes infected parasite sarcoptes scabiei whose symptoms explain most features chupacabra left little fur thickened skin rank odor o connor theorized attacks goats occurred because these animals greatly weakened so re going hard time hunting so forced into attacking livestock because s easier than running down rabbit deer     both dogs coyotes kill not consume prey either because inexperienced due injury difficulty killing prey     prey survive attack die afterwards from internal bleeding circulatory shock     presence two holes neck

predominant description since   unlike conventional predators chupacabra said drain all animal s blood sometimes organs usually through three holes shape downwards pointing triangle sometimes through only one two holes   chupacabra panic first started late   puerto rico farmers mass reporting mysterious killings various livestock these reports farmers recalled two puncture wounds animal carcasses   chupacabra killings soon associated seemingly untouched animal carcass other than puncture wounds which said used suck blood out victim reports such killings began spread around eventually out country reaching areas such as mexico brazil chile southern area united states most notably these areas experience frequent extreme dry seasons cases puerto rican reports   mexican reports   both countries currently experiencing dealing aftermath severe droughts investigations carried out both countries time noted certain dramatic violence these killings   these environmental conditions provide simple explanation livestock killings wild predators losing their usual prey drought therefore forced hunt livestock farmers sustenance thus same theory applied many other chupacabra attacks dry weather created more competitive environment native predators leading prey livestock survive such idea also explain increased violence killings hungry desperate predators driven hunt livestock avoid starvation causing increase both number livestock killings viciousness each one evidence such provided page   benjamin radford s book tracking chupacabra vampire beast fact fiction folklore radford s chart highlights ten significant reports chupacabra attacks seven which carcass recovered examined these autopsies concluded causes death as various animal attacks as displayed though animal

archaeologists pachacutec ordered construction royal estate his use as retreat most likely after successful military campaign although machu picchu considered royal estate not passed down line succession rather used   years before abandoned seemingly because spanish conquests other parts inca empire   possible most its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced travelers before spanish conquistadors even arrived area   during its use as estate estimated   people lived there most serving as support staff yanaconas     who lived there permanently though estate belonged pachacutec religious specialists temporary specialized workers mayocs lived there as well most likely ruler s well enjoyment during winter which usually harsher season staffing reduced few hundred servants few religious specialists focused maintenance alone   studies show according their skeletal remains most people who lived there immigrants from diverse backgrounds lacked chemical markers osteological markers if living there their entire lives instead research into skeletal remains found bone damage from various species water parasites indigenous different areas peru there also varying osteological stressors varying chemical densities suggesting varying long term diets characteristic specific regions spaced apart   these diets composed varying levels maize potatoes grains legumes fish last known short term diet these people overall composed less fish more corn suggests several immigrants from more coastal areas moved machu picchu where corn larger portion food intake   most skeletal remains

dead   much farming done machu picchu done its hundreds andenes man made terraces these terraces work considerable engineering built ensure good drainage soil fertility while also protecting mountain itself from erosion landslides however terraces not perfect as studies land show there landslides happened during construction machu picchu still visible places where terraces shifted landslides then stabilized inca as continued build around area   terraces also enabled irrigation increasing crop yields maize likely main crop due its ceremonial importance alongside possible cultivation potatoes   however terrace farming area makes up only     ha   acres land study soil around terraces showed what grown there mostly corn potatoes which not enough support   people living machu picchu explains why studies done food inca ate machu picchu suggest imported from surrounding valleys farther afield   estimated area around site received more than     mm   rain per year since ad   which more than needed support crop growth because ample rainfall machu picchu found irrigation not usually needed terraces terraces received so much rain built incan engineers specifically allow drainage excess water excavation soil analyses done kenneth wright      s showed terraces built layers bottom layer larger stones covered loose gravel   top gravel layer mixed sand gravel packed together rich topsoil covering research showed topsoil probably moved from valley floor terraces because much better than soil higher up mountain   little information exists surrounding human sacrifices machu picchu though
